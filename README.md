This project is part of the evaluation for earning a Master's degree in Data Analytics. It involves research for the second semester continuous assessment project, focusing on a topic that combines advanced data analytics, specifically Neural Networks, and Big Data Storage & Processing.

The goals include:

Analyzing the needs for storing and managing data in modern projects and comparing with older methods.
Understanding the design and structure of distributed Big Data systems and their components.
Choosing the best Big Data environment for accessing and processing data sets, managing data, and selecting the right analysis algorithms for the project's size and speed requirements.
For Advanced Data Analytics, the objectives are to:

Discuss the theories and uses of different neural networks.
Evaluate the project's requirements to decide on the best Neural Network solution, explaining and supporting this decision with insights gained.
