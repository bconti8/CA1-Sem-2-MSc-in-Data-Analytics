Overview:
This research focuses on analyzing vast amounts of email and text data using advanced computing techniques known as neural networks. With the rise of Big Data, managing and understanding this data has become crucial. Technologies such as Hadoop and PySpark play a significant role in handling the data, while neural networks are employed to extract meaningful insights from the text.

Key Technologies:

Hadoop: An open-source framework that allows for distributed storage and processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.
PySpark: A large-scale data processing engine that enhances data analysis and integration with Hadoop.
Neural Networks: Computational models, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), designed to recognize patterns and analyze text data.
Research Objectives:

To explore efficient methods for storing and processing large volumes of email and text data.
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different neural network models (ANN, CNN, RNN) in analyzing text data.
To apply these models to real-world datasets to assess their practical applicability and performance.
